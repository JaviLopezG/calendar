This project is a collaborative calendar that allows you to create a planner for any year. The cool thing is that it is a collaborative tool, you can share the link with other people and let them see the calendar or make it public to allow anyone with the link to modify the calendar. It updates in realtime (uses firestore) and don't require logins or any identifications.

## ✨ Features

*   **Real-time collaboration:** Share your calendar with others and see changes in real-time.
*   **No login required:** No need to create an account to use the app.
*   **Public and private calendars:** Create public calendars that anyone can see and edit, or private calendars that only you and your collaborators can access.
*   **Simple and intuitive interface:** The user interface is clean and easy to use.
